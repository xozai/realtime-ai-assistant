# Realtime AI Assistant

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Python 3.11+ realtime AI assistant for software discovery calls. It opens an OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket session, guides a requirements conversation, captures requirements through tool calls, and generates Agile user stories with Pydantic structured output.

Inspired by [`disler/poc-realtime-ai-assistant`](https://github.com/disler/poc-realtime-ai-assistant) — reuses its async Realtime API event loop, tool-chaining pattern, Rich terminal logs, in-session memory, and structured LLM parsing.

## Run

### Text mode (default)

```bash
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py
```

The web dashboard starts automatically at **http://localhost:8000**. Type messages at the prompt. Type `quit` or `exit` to end the session.

### Voice mode

```bash
pip install sounddevice   # one-time; requires a working microphone and speaker
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --voice
```

Streams PCM16 mono audio at 24 kHz to the Realtime API. Server-side VAD detects end of speech. Assistant audio responses are played back in real time via `SpeakerStream`.

### Scripted session

```bash
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --prompts "We need a task manager|Users need tasks and reminders|Generate stories"
```

### Resume a previous session

```bash
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --resume DISC-001
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project acme --resume DISC-001
```

Loads `sessions/<project_key>/<session_id>.json` before connecting — requirements, stories, summary, and costs from the prior session are restored.

### Multi-product usage

```bash
# Start a new discovery session for a specific project
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project acme

# Resume an existing session under the same project
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project acme --resume DISC-042
```

Sessions, transcripts, and exports are isolated per project key. Switching `--project` starts a completely separate context with no bleed between projects.

---

## Web Dashboard

The FastAPI dashboard runs in the same process and shows live requirements (with confidence badges), user stories, coverage analysis, cost summary, and executive summary.

Open: **http://localhost:8000**

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Inline dark-theme SPA |
| `GET` | `/api/requirements` | All captured requirements (includes `confidence`) |
| `PATCH` | `/api/requirements/{requirement_id}` | Update requirement text/category |
| `DELETE` | `/api/requirements/{requirement_id}` | Delete one requirement |
| `GET` | `/api/stories` | All generated user stories |
| `PATCH` | `/api/stories/{story_id}` | Update story fields, acceptance criteria, priority, points |
| `POST` | `/api/stories/{story_id}/refine` | Refine or regenerate one story using feedback and optional `requirement_ids` without replacing unrelated stories |
| `GET` | `/api/summary` | Current executive summary (`null` if not yet generated) |
| `POST` | `/api/summary/generate` | Generate and store executive summary via LLM |
| `GET` | `/api/coverage` | Requirement coverage report (coverage %, uncovered list, low-confidence count) |
| `GET` | `/api/session` | Session ID, project key, start time, counts, token costs |
| `GET` | `/api/events` | Server-Sent Events stream for dashboard updates and keep-alives |
| `POST` | `/api/export` | Export stories to JSON + Markdown |
| `POST` | `/api/jira/{project_key}` | Submit stories to Jira; pass `?dry_run=true` to preview payloads without creating issues |

---

### Realtime dashboard updates

The dashboard opens an `EventSource` connection to `GET /api/events`. Tool handlers publish compact events whenever session state changes, including requirement capture, story generation, selective story refinement, exports, and Jira submissions. Each event includes a session snapshot so the browser can refresh counts immediately without waiting for the next polling interval.

If the SSE connection is unavailable or reconnecting, the dashboard keeps the existing REST polling fallback so the UI continues to update in constrained browser or proxy environments.

---

## Tool Chain

The Realtime session registers these tools with the model:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `capture_requirement(requirement, category)` | Store a requirement; auto-deduplicates via embeddings and scores confidence via LLM |
| `ask_clarifying_question(topic, question)` | Log a clarifying question |
| `summarize_requirements()` | Print requirements grouped by confidence; Rich-warns on low-confidence items |
| `generate_user_stories()` | Produce a full replacement set of structured `UserStory` objects with `source_requirement_ids` via Chat Completions |
| `refine_user_story(story_id, feedback, requirement_ids)` | Refine or regenerate one existing story while preserving unrelated generated stories and recording refinement history |
| `generate_session_summary()` | Generate a structured executive summary (overview, key requirements, open questions, risks) |
| `analyze_story_coverage()` | Compute per-requirement coverage from story source IDs; flags gaps; warns on low-confidence |
| `dedupe_requirements()` | On-demand pairwise similarity pass over stored requirements; reports near-duplicate pairs |
| `export_user_stories(format, output_dir, export_name)` | Write JSON and Markdown exports including coverage report |
| `submit_stories_to_jira(project_key, dry_run)` | Preview or create Jira Story issues; reports per-story success/failure/skipped results and warns if uncovered must-have requirements exist |

**Requirement categories:** `functional` · `non-functional` · `constraint` · `assumption`

**Requirement confidence:** `high` · `medium` · `low` — scored by LLM on capture; low items flagged for follow-up

**Story priorities:** `must-have` · `should-have` · `could-have` · `wont-have`

**Story points:** Fibonacci — `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13` (Pydantic-validated)

---

## Confidence Scoring

Every captured requirement is automatically scored by the LLM for how clearly it was articulated:

- **high** — well-defined, specific, testable
- **medium** — reasonable but could use clarification
- **low** — vague or ambiguous; the assistant is prompted to re-ask

Low-confidence items are highlighted in `summarize_requirements`, shown with a colored badge in the dashboard (green / yellow / red), included in exports, and surfaced in the coverage report's `low_confidence_count`.

---

## Requirement Deduplication

When a new requirement is captured, its embedding (`text-embedding-3-small`) is compared against all stored requirements. If cosine similarity exceeds the threshold (default `0.85`, env-configurable via `DEDUP_THRESHOLD`), the duplicate is silently merged rather than stored. A tool result explains the merge with the existing requirement ID.

Run `dedupe_requirements` at any time for an on-demand pairwise report of near-duplicate pairs still in the session.

---

## Token and Cost Tracking

Token usage is accumulated across the Realtime API and Chat Completions calls and stored on `DiscoverySession.costs`. At session end, a Rich table is printed:

```
┌─────────────────┬───────────────┬────────────────┬───────────────┐
│ Model           │ Input tokens  │ Output tokens  │ Est. cost USD │
├─────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ Realtime        │ 12,450        │ 3,820          │ $0.139        │
│ Chat completions│ 1,200         │ 680            │ $0.010        │
│ Embeddings      │ 340           │ —              │ $0.000        │
├─────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ Total           │               │                │ $0.149        │
└─────────────────┴───────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

Cost rates are configurable via env vars (see Install section). The dashboard `GET /api/session` endpoint includes the full cost breakdown.

---

## Multi-Product Support

Use `--project PROJECT_KEY` to isolate sessions per product or client engagement:

```bash
# Two separate projects — no shared context
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project acme-crm
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project beta-payments
```

Sessions persist under `sessions/<project_key>/`, exports under `exports/<project_key>/`, and transcripts under `transcripts/<project_key>/`. Existing flat-path sessions (`sessions/<session_id>.json`) are still loaded as a backward-compatible fallback. The active project key is shown in the dashboard header and included in `GET /api/session`.

---

## Requirement Coverage Analysis

After generating stories, call `analyze_story_coverage`:

```text
Coverage: 75% (3/4 requirements covered)
Low-confidence requirements: 1

Uncovered:
  REQ-1D88F20A [functional]: Project owners can invite teammates by email.
```

The coverage report is included in JSON and Markdown exports, shown in the dashboard at `/api/coverage`, and checked before Jira submission — uncovered `must-have` requirements print a Rich warning but do not block the push.

---

## WebSocket Reconnection

If the Realtime WebSocket drops mid-call, the assistant reconnects automatically with bounded exponential backoff, replays `session.update`, and injects captured context back so the conversation continues without loss.

Configure via `--reconnect-attempts`, `--reconnect-delay`, and `--reconnect-max-delay`.

---

## Conversation Transcripts

Every session writes to `transcripts/<project_key>/<session_id>/`:

- `transcript.md` — human-readable Markdown with speaker labels
- `transcript.json` — machine-readable JSON with timestamps and metadata

Pass `--no-transcript` to disable.

---

## Session Persistence and Resume

Sessions are saved to `sessions/<project_key>/<session_id>.json`. Resume with:

```bash
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --project acme --resume DISC-001
```

Context is replayed as a `conversation.item.create` message so the assistant picks up exactly where the previous call left off.

---

## Voice Input + Output Mode

```bash
pip install sounddevice
python src/realtime_assistant/main.py --voice
```

- **Input:** `MicrophoneStream` streams PCM16 mono at 24 kHz; server-side VAD handles turn detection
- **Output:** `SpeakerStream` plays assistant audio responses in real time
- Text mode remains the default — `sounddevice` is only imported when `--voice` is active

---

## Jira Integration

Submits generated stories to Jira as Story issues via the Atlassian REST API v3. Uses stdlib `urllib` — no extra dependencies.

Add to `.env` (see Install section). The `submit_stories_to_jira` tool requires an explicit Jira project key — it is intentionally separate from the discovery `--project` key.

Use `dry_run=true` to preview the exact Jira issue payloads before anything is created:

```text
submit_stories_to_jira(project_key="PROJ", dry_run=true)
POST /api/jira/PROJ?dry_run=true
```

Real submissions return a per-story `results` list with `success`, `failure`, or `skipped` status. A single failed story does not stop later stories from being attempted. Successful real submissions still include the legacy `created_issues` list and `count` for existing callers.

### Priority mapping

| Story priority | Jira priority |
|---|---|
| `must-have` | Highest |
| `should-have` | High |
| `could-have` | Medium |
| `wont-have` | Low |

## License

All dependencies (`openai`, `pydantic`, `fastapi`, `rich`, `websockets`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `sounddevice`, `python-dotenv`) use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD-3). No copyleft dependencies.

---

## Notes

- `capture_requirement` now calls `text-embedding-3-small` for dedup and `gpt-4o` for confidence scoring on every requirement capture. Both calls are mocked in tests and lazy in voice mode.
- `generate_user_stories` uses Pydantic structured output via `client.beta.chat.completions.parse` with a JSON-schema fallback for compatible OpenAI client versions.
- Jira submission uses stdlib `urllib` only — no `requests` or `httpx` required in the core app.
- Sessions persist under `sessions/<project_key>/`. Flat-path sessions from earlier versions are still loaded as a fallback.
- Cost rates default to public OpenAI pricing but are fully configurable via env vars — update them when rates change.
- No credentials are hardcoded. All secrets are read from `.env` via `python-dotenv`.
